Game Description:
Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player must uncover squares in a grid, avoiding those that contain mines. \
The grid consists of multiple squares, each of which may or may not contain a mine. Non-mine squares show a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square. 
The goal is to uncover all non-mine squares without hitting any mines.

How to Play:
- Open a square: Left-click on a square to open it.
- Flag a mine: Right-click on a square to flag it if you suspect it contains a mine.
- Numbers on the squares: Squares that don't contain mines will display a number representing how many mines are adjacent to them.
- Game Over: The game ends if the player clicks on a square containing a mine or uncovers all the non-mine squares.
  
Key Features:
- Grid Layout: The grid can have customizable dimensions (e.g., 10x10, 16x16) and a variable number of mines.
- Difficulty Levels: Multiple difficulty levels based on the grid size and number of mines.
- Flagging Functionality: Allows the player to flag squares they suspect contain mines.
- Timer and Mine Count: The player can track the time taken and the number of remaining mines to flag.
- Restart Option: After the game ends (win or lose), the player can start a new game.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structures the game grid and other interface elements.
- CSS: Styles the game board, cells, and buttons.
- JavaScript: Handles the game logic, such as opening cells, checking for adjacent mines, and tracking the game state (win/lose).
